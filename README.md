Description
--------------------------------------------
    This game is a web-based re-creation of the classic arcade game Frogger.

--------------------------------------------
Project Goal
--------------------------------------------
    * In this project, we are provided with the visual assets and a game loop engine.
    * By using these tools, we are required to add a number of entities to
            the game including the player characters and enemies.
    * Not all images associated with the entities of the game are used as
          this game only contains the bare minimum features to satisfy the project
          requirements.


--------------------------------------------
Installation and Getting Started

--------------------------------------------
Gameplay Instructions
--------------------------------------------
	* The goal of the game is to get the boy from the grass field to the water without getting hit by the beetles that run horizontally from the left to right side of the grid.
	* Use the arrow keys to control the movements of the boy
	* If the boy is collided with one or more beetles, the player loses, the boy will have to be placed to his initial position, and start the game all over again
	* If the boy has reached the water without getting hit, the player wins.
